# PLUG.

**Programmable Locking UTXO Gateway**

Bitcoin smart contracts signed by your Ledger. Not a wallet — a programmability tool. You keep custody. The Ledger signs. The blockchain enforces.

### What is PLUG?

PLUG lets you create and spend complex Bitcoin transactions that are enforced by the network, not by trust. Your Ledger hardware wallet signs every transaction. Private keys never leave the device.

### Contracts

| Contract | Opcode | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Vault** | `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` | Lock sats until a future block height |
| **Inheritance** | `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` | Heir access after relative timelock |
| **HTLC** | `OP_SHA256 + CLTV` | Hash time-locked conditional payments |
| **Channel** | `OP_CHECKMULTISIG + CLTV` | 2-of-2 with timeout refund |
| **Pool** | `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` | M-of-N shared custody |
| **Atomic Swap** | `HTLC x 2` | Trustless P2P exchange via paired HTLCs |
| **CoinJoin** | `P2WPKH` | Serverless collaborative transactions |
| **OP_RETURN** | `OP_RETURN` | Embed data on the blockchain |

P2WSH (SegWit v0) + P2TR (Taproot). All scripts match the Ledger's miniscript compiler byte-for-byte.

### Architecture

```
iPhone
  |
  | Arti (embedded Tor)
  |
  v
.onion ─── Electrs REST ─── Bitcoin Core
            (your VPS)        (full node)
```

Two modes:
- **mempool.space** via Tor .onion (default)
- **Personal node** — your own Bitcoin Core + Electrs, zero third-party exposure

### Security

| | |
|---|---|
| **Keys** | Zero on device. Only xpubs. Ledger signs everything. |
| **Network** | All queries via embedded Tor (Arti). Broadcast with retry. |
| **Storage** | Keychain hardened. AES-256-GCM encrypted backups. |
| **Privacy** | CoinJoin, coin control, address rotation, UTXO shuffling. |
| **Telemetry** | Zero. No analytics, no crash reporters, no tracking SDKs. |
| **Dependencies** | One: `secp256k1.swift`. |

### Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| App | Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM + Swift Concurrency |
| Crypto | libsecp256k1 via GigaBitcoin/secp256k1.swift |
| Signing | Ledger V2 merkleized PSBT (BLE, CLA=0xE1) |
| Tor | Arti (Rust) compiled as iOS static library |
| Node | Bitcoin Core + Electrs (Docker) |
| Learn | Mastering Bitcoin 3rd Ed. (offline ebook) |
